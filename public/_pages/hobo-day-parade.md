The website for our first-ever live stream of the annual Hobo Day parade.

Built in just a few days, I used a number of new [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) tools. [Harp](http://harpjs.com/) produced a local copy of the website (written in two new languages, [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), and [Less](http://lesscss.org/)) while [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) let me share that website live to the rest of the team while I worked. This project became the template we use to build the majority of static websites today.

Posts to social media in the weeks leading up to Hobo Day help to build a crescendo around the event and the website, leading to more people (62%) watching the parade's live stream from the website than from YouTube itself. Nearly half of viewers (45%) did so from a mobile device, another record at the time.

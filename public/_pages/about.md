## About

Hello. My name is Erik Ebsen.

Currently, I develop Drupal, WordPress, CommonSpot, and client-side websites for South Dakota State University.

I've also developed farm-management applications for iOS; managed, edited, and written magazine and web content for a large Midwestern university; designed brochures for a state education department; and edited a college newspaper. I also help out on the family farm & ranch.

In terms of education, I'm an alumnus of the Pragmatic Studio for iOS and, while working there full time, completed the core course requirements for the Computer Science minor at South Dakota State University.

Before that, I graduated from college with degrees in English Literature and Mass Communications.

You can find me on Twitter or by email.

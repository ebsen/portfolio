The West Boyd College Connection is a resource for students primarily in the Nebraska school district beginning their research into post-secondary education. In addition to information on college interviews, applications, and campus visits, the website features a fairly exhaustive catalog of area scholarships.

Currently, the school's guidance counselor curates this list of scholarships by hand, sorting them by due date. March alone includes roughly a hundred entries. The website is not particularly friendly to mobile displays devices either.

With the new Drupal version of the site, she'll enter every scholarship exactly the same way. Drupal's powerful [Views](https://www.drupal.org/project/views) module will do all the sorting and categorized display for her. Students with mobile devices will be able to use the site as effectively as those with a laptop or desktop computer.

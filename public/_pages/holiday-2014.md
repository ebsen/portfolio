At the end of each year, the university publishes a video to highlight the accomplishments made by its faculty and staff. This year, that email campaign also kicked off #WeAreSDState, a campaign to promote the university's value around the region.

We wanted the website hosting the video to match the email used to distribute it. This led me to experiment with animating backgrounds and cross-fading images in the browser. While the final product didn't ship with these features, they served as excellent reminders that "the web" isn't the same across screens and devices.

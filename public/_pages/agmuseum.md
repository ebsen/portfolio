A custom-themed WordPress site built from Photoshop designs. It features a prominent carousel on the homepage and several post types to display information in various places across the site.

I led a team of myself and two student developers to prototype these designs into code. I chose [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) as the front-end framework and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to compile it. These technologies helped us built the site responsively, allowing it to work across difference screen sizes. We then converted the resulting code to work with WordPress.

This was our first project using responsive design and the above technologies. Today, every project we start is responsive, we have several sites running on WordPress, and we use Node with nearly every website we have.

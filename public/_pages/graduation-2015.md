The current iteration of the graduation website adds [social media integration through Storify](https://storify.com/SDState/sdstate15), [a music playlist from Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/sdstate/playlist/2xNGtjV0ghaypMHwCmBwfv), and [a Facebook photo album](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152904174661647.1073741842.88914146646&type=1). I also scripted our Git deployment process to make publishing and updating the site much simpler.

Building on [last year's](#graduation-2014) success, the website reached people in 43 states and 32 countries on commencement day. A strong majority of those visitors (57%) came from mobile, breaking our previous record. The Facebook photo album on the site reached over 100,000 people.

Like a phoenix, this website undergoes perpetual rebirth. Unfortunately, that also means that it's constantly going up in flames.

This time, I wanted to feature a portfolio of some of the work I'm most proud of. To do this, I used a trick I learned from building [Songbook](#songbook) to list my projects as metadata and loop through them to build the site automatically. This also allowed me write about my projects in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format.

An official university landing page to highlight the accomplishments of our graduating bachelors, masters, and Ph.D. students, including live streams of the commencement ceremonies over YouTube, [our own original recap video](https://youtu.be/VTRt64lE3uQ), and curated Instagram and Twitter posts.

As our first experience at streaming live video, we needed a lean website that would perform really well. So, we opted to serve static files in place of a database and we optimized common performance bottlenecks to reduce the size of the page.

I also worked with IT to put together a new way for us to publish the website: [Git](http://git-scm.com/). This also allows us to much more easily track changes in the code and revert them when bugs are found.

The live stream was a huge success for us, reaching hundreds of people across 26 states and 11 countries and reaching the highest number of mobile viewers (32%) of any university website to date. In the time since, the recap video has reached thousands of viewers.

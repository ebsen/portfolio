The current iteration of the graduation website adds social media integration through Storify, a music playlist from Spotify, and a Facebook photo album. I also scripted our Git deployment process to make publishing and updating the site much simpler.

Building on [last year's](#graduation-2014) success, the website reached people in 43 states and 32 countries on commencement day. A strong majority of those visitors (57%) came from mobile, breaking our previous record. The Facebook photo album on the site reached over 100,000 people.

The website for our first-ever live stream of the annual Hobo Day parade.

Posts to social media in the weeks leading up to Hobo Day help to build a crescendo around the event and the website, leading to more people (62%) watching the parade's live stream from the website than from YouTube itself. Nearly half of viewers (45%) did so from a mobile device, another record at the time.

This site stands out for another reason. To build it, I used a number of new [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) tools, namely [Harp](http://harpjs.com/), [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/), [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), and [Less](http://lesscss.org/). This project grew into the template we use for most of our static sites today.

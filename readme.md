## The portfolio

Hello. My name is Erik Ebsen. I'm a Christian, a husband, and a father of three. I work as a web developer for [South Dakota State](http://www.sdstate.edu). This website demonstrates a few of the projects, both personal and professional, that I've built or been a part of building.

## The website

This website is built with BrowserSync, Gulp, and Harp, among other things (like ☕️).
